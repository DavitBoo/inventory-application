# My Stock Controll App for my Luthier material

This is a CRUD App built with Node.js using Mongo DB, Express.js, EJS and Bootstrap.

ðŸ‘‰ Live demo will be here soon

## The aim of the project

Basicaly to practice with **Express.js**, **MongoDB** and templating languages like **EJS** or Pug.
I personaly used **EJS** because the writting is more similar to HTML, I also did a tutorial using Pug before so I wanted to try something different.
For the styles I am using **Bootstrap 5**, since in the company I am working right now is what we use, so it was a nice chance to explore some features by myself
