## The aim of the project

Basicaly to practice with **Express.js**, **MongoDB** and templating languages like **EJS** or Pug.
I personaly used **EJS** because the writting is more similar to HTML, I also did a tutorial using Pug before so I wanted to try something different.
For the styles I am using **Bootstrap 5**, since in the company I am working right now is what we use, so it was a nice chance to explore some features by myself
