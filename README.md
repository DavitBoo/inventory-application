## The aim of the project

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with **Express.js**, **MongoDB** and templating languages like **EJS** or Pug.
I personaly chose to use **EJS** because its syntax is more similar to HTML. I previously completed a tutorial using Pug, so I wanted to try something different this time.
For styling, I opted to utilize **Bootstrap 5**. This choice aligns with the tools we use in my current workplace, providing me with an opportunity to explore its features independently.
